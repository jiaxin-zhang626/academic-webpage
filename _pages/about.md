I am a sixth-year graduate student at Caltech, advised by [Professor Nikolai Makarov]{https://pma.caltech.edu/people/nikolai-makarov}. 
Before my doctoral studies, I received a B.S. in Mathematics from Peking University.

My research involves analysis, probability theory, and mathematical physics. To be more precise, I am interested in the theory of Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE) and its connections to mathematical conformal field theory (CFT).
