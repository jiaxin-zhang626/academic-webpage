I am a sixth-year graduate student at Caltech, advised by Professor [Nikolai Makarov](https://pma.caltech.edu/people/nikolai-makarov). 
Before my doctoral studies, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Peking University.

My research involves analysis, probability theory, and mathematical physics. To be more precise, I am interested in the theory of Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE) and its connections to mathematical conformal field theory (CFT).
